## Descriptions

Using handlebars and data stored in mySQL this application allows users to add and store a list of burgers. When a burger is produced it will display in the available burgers column along with two buttons. These buttons allow the user to "consume" the burger which transfers the burger to the right column and the other button allows the user to remove the burger all-together.
